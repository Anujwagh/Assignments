    <h1>The Impact of Social Media on Society</h1>
    <p>In the last two decades, social media has dramatically transformed the 
        way people communicate, share information, and perceive the world around 
        them. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (now X), TikTok, and 
        others have become deeply integrated into everyday life. While social
         media offers many benefits, such as connecting people globally and 
         providing platforms for self-expression and activism, it also presents
          significant challenges related to mental health, misinformation, 
          and privacy. As such, understanding both the positive and negative 
          effects of social media is essential for navigating the modern digital 
          age.</p>
